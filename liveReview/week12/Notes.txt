=======================================
methods for creating function

    Access Modifier Specifier returnType methodName(parameters){
            statements;
    }

Access Modifiers:
    * public ---> allows to reach from every other class or packages
    * private ----> only inside the same class you can reach
    * default    ----> OOP
    * protected  -----> OOP

specifier: Static keyword, Final

returnType: void or eny Data Type

PIQ: What are the differences between Constructors and Methods:
        1. No return type


        Constructor: special method, it is a MUST, it is used to create and (maybe)initializing fields of the object
        Access-Modifier ClassName(parameter){
            statements;
        }

object: new ClassName();   --- > we are calling the constructor

instance (multiple copies) variables or methods: each object has it's own copy

static (one copy) : all the objects they have the same copy and share it.

Task 1:
Employee:
	attribute
name, jobTitle, ID, salary

	add a constructor to initialize all the fields

	asString()
