Map Interface ---> does NOT extend Collection Interface, but we can consider as part Collection Framework
- pairs of Data: key - value
- keys must be unique(not duplicated), values can be dublicate
- does not support primitives

HashMap(C) implements Map Interface  (similar to HashSet functions)
order is random, faster, accepts null key, using hash code

LinkedHashMap(C) --(LinkedList)
keeps the insertion order, accepts null key

TreeMap(C)  - TreeSet
Sorted, does not accept null key

HashTable(C)  --- kind of like Vector
does not accept null key, order is random, synchronized (slower)

ENUM: constant values that have been predefined : compass directions (North, East ...)
