Arrays: int code = 200; // single data

DATA Structures: popular one is Array
- ArrayList, List, Set, Map ....

In Java, Arrays are fixed size, not re-sizable

Arrays hold same type of Data

Default values of Data Types
int: 0
double: 0.0
String: null

Arrays start from zero index

FOR EACH LOOPs:
it is used when you have collection
arraylist,map,list,set....

We need two parts:
1. temporary variable: needs to be same data type with the Array
2. collection reference after ":" statement

for(int num : codes){  statement }
Disadvantage: No backard and you can not jump to different index
