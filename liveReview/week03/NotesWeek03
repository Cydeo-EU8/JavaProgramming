Q1 : does the folder name (e.g., src, liveReview) have to start with lowercase ?
        package and directory names should start with lowercase
Q2 : System.out.print.ln(4+5 +" " + 4+5) it gives me 9 45 on the console.
Why it is not doing addition after the space?so, Why is it concatenating instead of adding after space?
