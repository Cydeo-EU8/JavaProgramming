##Encapsulation
###What is Encapsulation?
1. Data Hiding
    - Hiding the data by providing private access modifiers
2. How do we perform? (**PIQ**)
   - make all class fields private
   - create public getter: to read the data 
    - create public setter: to write the data
 3. Encapsulation helps us to manipulate the data field with certain conditions(we will apply this concept with Singleton Driver Class Design)
